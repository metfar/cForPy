# cForPy
Just a compilation of functions (remainings of BASIC/C/CPP/PHP).
  
This library is a combination of a lot of previous jobs.
I started it when I began to study C language, with a QBasic baggage.
So, this is based on my BASIC.h(1988), bib.h(1989), bibc.py (c/cpp compat),
func.py (basic functions), php.py (php compat).

Some modifications to work with bash.
